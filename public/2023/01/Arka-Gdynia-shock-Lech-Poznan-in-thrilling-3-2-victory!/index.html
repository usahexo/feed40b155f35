<p>The home side took the lead in the fifth minute through Piotr Wlazlo, but Lech Poznan were level just two minutes later thanks to a goal from Maciej Makuszewski.</p>
<p>However, Arka Gdynia regained the lead in the 23rd minute when Wlazlo netted his second goal of the match, and they held on to record a dramatic 3-2 win.</p>

The home side were on the front foot for large parts of the game but could not find a way past Legia goalkeeper Arkadiusz Malarz. Jakub Kuba and Konstantin Vassiljev both came close for Arka, while Marek Saganowski had the best chance for Legia midway through the second half but saw his effort saved by Arka goalkeeper Przemysław Tytoń. The result sees Arka stay top of the Ekstraklasa standings, while Legia move up to sixth place.</p>

The home side were good from the start, and it was no surprise when they took the lead in the 10th minute. Early substitute Mateusz Lisandowski was involved as he latched onto a Kacper Przybylko ball over the top, before finishing clinically past goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton.</p>
<p>Arka doubled their lead just two minutes later, as Andrzej Niedzielski found himself in space inside the penalty area and drilled a low shot past Tyton. The writing was on the wall for Pogon at this point, and they rarely looked like getting back into the game. Substitute Maksymilian Stryjek had to be alert to keep out a header from Rafal Murawski just after half-time, but it was only a temporary respite for the visitors.</p>
<p>In the 75th minute, Arka put the seal on an impressive victory as Przybylko grabbed his second goal of the game. The striker collected a long ball over the top before firing into the bottom corner to make it 3-0. It was a deserved win for Arka, who moved up to second place in the table with this victory.</p>

In what was a very tense affair at the Stadion GOSiR in Gdynia, Arka Gdynia finally secured their place in this year's Ekstraklasa play-offs with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Wisla Plock. The only goal of the game came midway through the second half, as Arka captain Michał Marczak headed home a cross from Kamil Zapolnik. The result means that Arka retain their sixth place in the table, four points clear of seventh-placed Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała with just two games remaining.


The win was not without its nervy moments for Arka, however, as Wisla created several good chances in both halves. In the first period, Jakub Kosecki saw his effort well saved by Arkadiusz Malarz, whilst Dawid Kownacki and Maciej Majkowski were both denied by the woodwork. In the second half, it was Malarz who kept his side in front with a string of good saves to thwart Kownacki, Majkowski and substitute Patryk Lipski.Ultimately, though, Arka were able to hold on for the three points and clinch their play-off spot. "This was an important win - not just because it means we're in the play-offs, but also because it gets us one step closer to our goal of qualifying for Europe," said Marczak after the game. "We've been playing really well over the past few weeks and I think we can go into the play-offs with confidence."


Arka will now turn their attention to next weekend's clash with leaders Legia Warsaw at the Stadion Wojska Polskiego. A win for Arka would see them leapfrog their opponents and move into second place in the table, setting up a mouthwatering final round of fixtures against Górnik Zabrze in two weeks' time.

#  Dramatic injury time winner gives Arka Gdynia edge over Lechia Gdansk in heated derby clash!

ARKA GDYNIA 1-0 LECHIA GDANSK

Sunday's hotly contested derby clash between Arka Gdynia and Lechia Gdansk produced a dramatic late winner as Arkadiusz Milik snatched all three points for the home side with an injury time strike. The goal capped a fine individual performance from the young striker, who was a constant threat to the Lechia defence throughout the game.

The match began in lively fashion, with both sides playing some attractive attacking football. However, it was Arka who created the first real chance of the match, as Milik forced a good save from Grzegorz Sandomierski with a well-hit shot from outside the area. Milik was then unlucky not to score shortly afterwards, as his header from Rafał Wolski's free-kick crashed against the crossbar.

Lechia gradually began to come into the game as the first half progressed, and they should have taken the lead shortly before halftime when Jakub Wilk fired over from just six yards out after being sent clear by Lukas Haraslin. However, Arka were also dangerous on the break and came close to taking the lead themselves on a number of occasions.

The second half continued in much the same vein as the first, with both teams creating chances but failing to take any of them. With time running out it looked like this might be another stalemate between these two fierce rivals. However, in injury time Milik produced a moment of magic to give Arka all three points. After taking advantage of some slack marking by the Lechia defence, he calmly finished past Sandomierski to give his side victory.

This win gives Arka renewed hope of avoiding relegation this season, while for Lechia it is yet another frustrating defeat that sees them slip further away from promotion contention.
