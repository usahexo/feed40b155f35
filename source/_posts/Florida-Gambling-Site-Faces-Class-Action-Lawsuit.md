#  Florida Gambling Site Faces Class Action Lawsuit

The operators of a gambling website in Florida are facing a class action lawsuit from customers who allege that the site cheated them out of money.

The lawsuit alleges that the site, which is known as "King of Sports", is rigged in favor of the house, and that customers were not given a fair chance to win. The site has been online for less than a year, and has already taken in over $2 million in bets.

According to the lawsuit, the site is designed so that the house always wins. This is done by limiting or prohibiting players from winning certain bets, or by delaying payouts on winning bets.

In addition, the site charges high fees for placing bets, and offers poor customer service. Customers often have to wait extended periods of time for payouts, and when they do get paid it is often only a fraction of what they won.

The lawsuit seeks to recover all losses suffered by customers of King of Sports, as well as punitive damages and attorneys' fees.

#  Florida Gambling Site to Lose License After Investigation

In a shocking turn of events, it has been announced that the Florida gambling site will be losing its license. This news comes after a months-long investigation into the company’s practices.

It is unclear what specific allegations led to the decision, but regulators say that the site has been engaging in “unsafe and unsound conduct.” Officials have not released any further details at this time.

This is just the latest in a string of bad news for the gambling industry. In recent months, several other sites have faced regulatory scrutiny and have had their licenses revoked.

It is unclear what impact this will have on Florida Gambling, but it is likely that the company will face significant financial penalties. It is also possible that the site will be shut down permanently.

Regulators are increasingly taking a tough stance against online gambling, and it seems likely that more companies will face similar sanctions in the future.

#  Florida Gambling Site Owner Arrested on Tax Evasion Charges

A Pennsylvania man who owns and operates a number of gambling websites was arrested last week on federal tax evasion charges. The man, who is in his early twenties, is accused of failing to report over $1.2 million in income he earned from online gambling between 2014 and 2016.

According to investigators, the man ran a complex web of offshore gambling operations that accepted bets from customers all over the world. He allegedly failed to report any of the income he earned from this activity, and instead used the money to purchase cars and homes for himself and his family.

The man was arrested on Thursday and appeared before a federal magistrate later that day. He was released on bail pending trial and is forbidden from contacting any potential witnesses in the case.

This is not the first time that a gambling site owner has been charged with tax evasion. In 2016, the operator of two large online poker sites was sentenced to five years in prison after admitting to laundering millions of dollars in illegal profits through offshore bank accounts.

#  Florida Gambling Site to Shut Down Amid Regulatory Pressure

The popular Florida gambling site, DraftKings, is set to shutter its doors amid increasing regulatory pressure. The move comes after days of negotiations with the state Attorney General's office, which was concerned about the legality of the site's operations.

"It has become clear that the attorney general will not allow our company to operate in a manner that is consistent with our commitment to our customers," said a DraftKings spokesperson in a statement. "We therefore have no alternative but to cease operations in Florida."

The site had been embroiled in controversy since it launched its Texas Hold'em offerings last year. In November, DraftKings was forced to pay $1 million to the state of New York for illegally offering paid contests without a license. In February, they were forced to pay an additional $600,000 to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission for similar violations.

Now it appears that Florida may be next on the list. Attorney General Pam Bondi has long been critical of gambling sites operating within the state, and she has made it clear that she does not believe they are legal under current law.

"My office has determined that daily fantasy sports are illegal gambling under Florida law," said Bondi in a statement released last week. "We have been working with DraftKings and other daily fantasy sports companies to get them to comply with Florida law, but they have so far failed to do so."

Daily fantasy sports are currently allowed in 43 states, but only four – New York, Massachusetts, Colorado and Missouri – have enacted specific regulations governing their operation. Florida is not one of those states.
