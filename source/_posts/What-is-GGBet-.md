#  What do the Houston Astros have to do in order to make it to the playoffs?

Houston Astros are a very strong team and if they play to their potential they can easily make it to the playoffs. The first step they need to take is to clinch a spot in the postseason. In order to do that, they need to win the division or claim one of the two Wild Card spots. They are in good shape right now as they are currently in 1st place in the AL West division with a record of 73-43.

If they want to stay on top, they will need to continue playing well. One thing that could help them is getting back RHP Lance McCullers Jr., who has been out since early July due to an elbow injury. McCullers Jr. is one of the teamâ€™s best pitchers and his return could give them a boost heading into the last few months of the season.

The Astros will also have to watch out for teams like the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox, who are both hot on their heels in terms of playoff contention. The Indians currently have a record of 71-45 and are in 2nd place in the AL Central division, while the Red Sox have a record of 71-47 and are in 1st place in the AL East division.

It will be interesting to see how the Astros fare down the stretch and whether or not they can accomplish their goal of making it to the playoffs.
