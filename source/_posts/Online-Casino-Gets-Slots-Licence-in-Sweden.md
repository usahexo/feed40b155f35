#  Online Casino Gets Slots Licence in Sweden

The Svenska Spel, the state-owned provider of gaming products in Sweden, has been awarded a licence to operate a new online casino with slots.

The Svenska Spel said that it plans to start operating the site in the autumn of 2017.

The licence was granted by the Swedish gambling authority, Lotteriinspektionen.

A spokesman for Svenska Spel said: “We are pleased that we have been granted a licence to offer a new online casino with slots. This is in line with our strategy to broaden our offering of gaming products and services.”

He added that the new site would be aimed at both Swedish and international players.

#  Gambling Mogul Buys Bookmakers for Millions

The gambling mogul, who wishes to remain anonymous, has recently bought out three of the UK's leading bookmakers for a reported £60 million.

The bookmakers, which have been in business for over 100 years combined, have been struggling in recent years as online betting has taken over the market.

The mogul has plans to revive the businesses and make them more competitive in the online space. He has already made some changes, including introducing new betting products and improving customer service.

He also plans to invest in marketing and technology to make the bookmakers more user-friendly.

Some industry experts are skeptical about the mogul's plans, but he is confident that he can revive the businesses and turn them into profitable ventures.

#  UK Bookmaker Fined for Laundering Money

The UK’s Gambling Commission has fined a leading bookmaker £5.9 million for failing to protect customers from being scammed out of money by criminal gangs.

The bookmaker, which is one of the largest in the country, was found to have failed to carry out adequate anti-money laundering checks on its customers. This allowed criminal gangs to use the bookmaker’s accounts to launder money.

The Gambling Commission said that the bookmaker had “rushed through” approvals for new customers without proper checks, and had failed to keep track of where the money was coming from. This left the door open for criminal gangs to exploit the bookmaker’s systems.

In a statement, the Gambling Commission said that it was “essential that gambling businesses take their responsibilities seriously when it comes to stopping money laundering and safeguarding against crime”.

This is not the first time that the Gambling Commission has fined a bookmaker for money laundering offences. In March 2017, a leading bookmaker was fined £6.2 million for similar offences.

#  Online Gambling Firm Pays Out over $1.5M in Wins

In a testament to the legitimacy and security of online gambling, one of the industry’s top firms has just paid out more than $1.5M in total winnings over the last few days.

This massive payout comes from none other than 888 Holdings, a UK-based company who have been leaders in the online gambling space since their inception in 1997. 888 Holdings is publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange and is one of the most respected brands in all of online gambling.

The payouts come as a result of wins on several different games offered by 888, including slots, table games, and live casino offerings. Some notable individual payouts include a €149,873.92 win on a single spin of an 888 slot machine and a £67,711 payout from a single bet on a blackjack table.

888 Holdings isn’t the only online gambling firm seeing big payouts lately - competitors such as PokerStars and Microgaming have both had recent winners scooping up six-figure payouts. But with its long history and industry-leading products, 888 Holdings is certainly at the top of its game.

If you’re looking to get in on some of the action yourself, be sure to check out one of 888 Holdings’ many trusted brands - including Casino888, Bet888, and Sport888 - for some of the best gaming experiences available anywhere online. With so many big winners already having hit it big, there’s never been a better time to give online gambling a try!

Norwegian gaming company plans US expansion

Oslo, Norway-based mobile game developer and publisher Funcom is expanding its operations to the United States. The company, which is best known for developing the popular “The Secret World” and “Age of Conan” games, has set up a development studio in Los Angeles and is eyeing an initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

"The US is the largest games market in the world and it's our intention to be a leading player there," Funcom CEO Rui Casais said in a statement. "We are investing heavily in building out our team in Los Angeles and are confident that we have a world-class product pipeline that will excite gamers across all platforms."

Funcom's move into the United States mirrors that of other large European gaming companies like French publishers Ubisoft Entertainment SA and Vivendi SA, as well as Sweden's King Digital Entertainment Plc. All three companies have set up or acquired studios in California in order to tap into the lucrative American market.

Revenue from digital gaming has been growing rapidly in recent years as more people shift away from traditional console gaming systems like Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox One. In 2016, global revenue from digital games was estimated at nearly $100 billion, according to research firm Newzoo BV. The U.S. market accounted for more than half of that total.

Funcom's strategy appears to be paying off so far. The company announced last month that it had swung back into profitability during the second quarter of 2018, thanks primarily to strong sales of its "Secret World Legends" game released in March.
