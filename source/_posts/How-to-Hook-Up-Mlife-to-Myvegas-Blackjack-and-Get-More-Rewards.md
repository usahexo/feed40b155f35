#  How to Play Myvegas Blackjack with Mlife Rewards

If you’re a fan of Blackjack, you’ll definitely want to try out the Myvegas Blackjack app. Not only is this one of the most popular casino games around, but it can also be enjoyed from the comfort of your own home – or while on the go.

In order to play Myvegas Blackjack, you’ll need to create an account with MGM Resorts International’s Mlife Rewards program. This is a free program that allows you to earn points every time you gamble or stay at one of MGM’s resorts. You can then use these points to redeem rewards such as complimentary stays, dining credits, and more.

Once you have created an account and registered for Mlife Rewards, you’ll need to download the Myvegas app. This is a free app that can be accessed via Google Play or the App Store. After launching the app, simply tap on “START PLAYING” and then select “BLACKJACK TABLE GAMES.”

You will then be given the option to either play for free or for real money. If you’re just starting out, we recommend playing for free until you become more comfortable with the game rules and betting strategy.

Once you are ready to start playing for real money, we suggest betting low until you feel comfortable with the game. In Blackjack, your goal is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a “blackjack”), or by scoring more points than the dealer without going over 21.

To begin a round of Blackjack, players must first place a bet. The minimum bet in this game is $1 and the maximum bet is $500 per hand. Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer will deal two cards face up to each player as well as one card face up to himself/herself. The player with the highest value card starts first and play proceeds clockwise from there.

Players must now decide whether they want to hit (take another card) or stand (draw no more cards). If their total score exceeds 21 after hitting (or if they take too many cards and bust), they automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has ended up with. Players are also allowed to double down on their original bet (double their stake) which means they receive just one more card but cannot hit again afterwards. Splitting pairs is also an option whereby if a player has two cards of equal rank (e.g., two kings), he/she can split them into two separate hands and wager additional funds on each hand accordingly. If both hands subsequently win, then players receive double their payout! However, note that splitting Aces results in each Ace being counted as 1 point only (rather than 11).

The dealer must draw until his/her hand totals 17 points or above; anything below 17 means the dealer busts and all players still in contention automatically win their respective bets. When both player(s) and dealer have finished playing their hands,the highest value hand wins – unless somebody has blackjack which trumps everything else! In case of a tie between player(s) and dealer, it is considered a push resulting in nobody winning or losing any money wagered in that particular hand..

So there you have it – everything you need to know about playing Myvegas Blackjack like a pro! Just remember: practice makes perfect so be sure to brush up on your strategy before hitting up any real-money tables!
